        <p><strong>Network types</strong></p>
        <p>Local area Network (LAN) : devices that are connected within ig a local network work.</p>
        <p>Wide Area Network (WAN) : this is a network that that is ig just bigger it can connect various other LAN'S into the same WAN. an example of this would be the internet it is basically a giant complier of various local networks kinda.</p>
        <p>Wireless local area Network (WLAN) : like lan but for device that are connected wirelessly</p>
        <p>Storage area Network (SAN) : a network for storage devices.</p>
        <p>Virtual private network (VPN) : secure point to point connect between 2 network endpoints ; can allow you to connect to a group of servers that are firewalled off, or just remotely connect to a local network. it can do alot more too.</p>
        <p><strong>Some definitions</strong></p>
        <p><em>node :</em> a network type that can send, receive, store, and create data.</p>
        <p><em>router :</em> can be physical or virtual, a router sends information (data packets) between networks. (in my experience it can be a hassle to set up a virtual router even though doing so allows you much more control over the system going physical its always easier at the end of the day.)</p>
        <p><em>switch :</em> device that in a way &quot;clusters&quot; together other device allowing them to communicate more efficiently. their are 2 main kinda a managed switch and unmanaged, managed switches normally support things like qos, vlan, IGMP and Link aggregation. where as unmanaged switches are basically just like a addon that allows you to add more ethernet ports they really don't do anything other then that.</p>
        <p><em>ports :</em> its best to think of then as like physical ports you would find on a router, they allow connections weather that be incoming or outgoing to plugin to that port and use it to transfer information their are a ridiculous amount of ports, somewhere around 65,530 something i think idk.</p>
        <p><em>Firewall :</em> network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing connects to a network ensuring that unauthorized users don't have access.</p>
        <p><em>load balancers :</em> distribute network traffic across devices, and do it efficiently.</p>
            <p><strong>ISO Model</strong></p>
            <p>The iso model consists of 7 layers :</p>
            <p>-application</p>
            <p>-presentation</p>
            <p>-session</p>
            <p>-transport</p>
            <p>-network</p>
            <p>-data link</p>
            <p>-physical</p>
            <p><strong>Encapsulation</strong></p>
            <p>Is the process in which data can be transferred from one computer to another.</p>
            <p><strong>TCP/IP model</strong></p>
            <p>-application</p>
            <p>-transport</p>
            <p>-internet</p>
            <p>-network</p>
            <p>The TCP/IP model is used in the real world the ISO model is only used in theory for teaching people.</p>
            <p>TCP : means Transmission Control Protocol</p>
            <p>IP : means Internet Protocol</p>
            <p><strong>TCP</strong></p>
            <p>TPC is a connection based protocol meaning before you send data via TCP you must form a stable connection between 2 computers call a 3 way handshake.</p>
            <p>TCP/IP was create to sort out consistently problems between computers.</p>
