    <p>
      <strong>Linux Theory</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Linux has 4 main parts:</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The Kernel</em>:</p>
    <p>the kernel handles files, disks, networking, etc.</p>
    <p>
      <em>supplied programs</em>
    </p>
    <p>these are programs that are install on the operating system such as the file manager for example caja, or a browser such as fire fox.</p>
    <p>
      <em>the shell</em>
    </p>
    <p>allows the user to type commands, test commands, excute them and display the results of such commands. Within the shell their many shells that have specific jobs such as, kron shell, c shell, bash shell.</p>
    <p>
      <em>X or desktop enviroment or window manager</em>
    </p>
    <p>their are window managers like gnome i think, and lightdm and various others. Then their are desktop enviroments like, gnome, KDE, xfce, i3 not really a desktop enviroment but kinda cant remeber the name, awesome, lxde which i think is depreciated in favor of lxqt i think.
my favorites would probally be gnome, cinnemon, and i3 i love i3 beacuse it allows me to keep my hands away from my mouse and encourages me to use the terminal more it overall just make everything faster
however its a pain to try to setup the config file so i normally stay away from it unless the distro has a i3 built in that already looks nice for example manjaro linux.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Linux File System</strong>
    </p>
    <p>directories is just a fancy word for folder i mean not really but its best to think of it that way.</p>
    <p>directories form a hiearchy or " tree " in which they may contain other files or subfiles within themselves.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Home directories</em>
    </p>
    <p>users personal files often found in home dir. ( EX. cd /home/jack or su jack and cd ( use cd cus when you su from root your normally still in the /root dir) would probally get me into the home dir of the user "jack" or you could use /root to get into the home dir of the user root. you get it by now just home/specified user. )</p>

    <p>
      <strong>System dir</strong>
    </p>
    <p>this dir normally contains system files, applications, man files or docs, basically everthing. wont really use unless your administrating systems.</p>
    <p>
      <em>programs</em>
    </p>
    <p>bin : normally contains programs</p>
    <p>sbin : superuser programs</p>
    <p>lib : code for programs</p>
    <p>
      <em>docs</em>
    </p>
    <p>doc : documentation</p>
    <p>info : info file about various things</p>
    <p>man : manual pages ( Ex. man nmap )</p>
    <p>share : info</p>
    <p>
      <em>configuration</em>
    </p>
    <p>etc : config files for system</p>
    <p>init.d : config files for linux boot</p>
    <p>rc.d : also config for booting</p>
    <p>
      <em>hardware</em>
    </p>
    <p>dev : files for interacting with hardware</p>
    <p>media : mount point</p>
    <p>mnt : mount point</p>
    <p>
      <em>runtime</em>
    </p>
    <p>var : computer files updated and created while system is running</p>
    <p>run : PID contains id's of running processes</p>
    <p>tmp : temp file storage</p>
    <p>spool : files in transit or waiting to be in transit aka queued</p>
